## Project Description:
- Purr Mate is a website where users can go to find a cat they can adopt based on the results from the personality quiz.

- - Once results are generated, user has the option to rate the cats and save them for adoption.

We also made it fun and interactive with a Giggles page with random cat jokes if your need of giggles, a great break from humans!
